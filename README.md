This is all the contents that I have done for the research training course in Tampere University course

There are separate directories for each period of the course.

First session: 
- Understanding the basics of Zernike polynomials and how to use them in the image processing.
- Understanding the basics of genetic algorithms and how to use them in for finding the shortest path going through all the cities.

Second session:
- Initial code belongs to https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2509520 (won't be uploaded to the repository)
- Understanding 4f system and how to apply Fourier transform to the 4f system
- Understanding the properties of the light and how to transfer the light from the beginning image to the SLM
- Modify, Coding and Applying genetic algorithm for generating the image from the beginning image

Third session (in progress):
- Initial code: https://github.com/isetbio/isetbio/tree/master/external/zernike + modified_file.mlx (undone)
- Applying Zernike polynomials code to the SLM.
- Get the main idea of the genetic algorithm and how to apply it to the SLM for preparing going to the Lab. Coding to:
    + Generate a random collection of coefficents bounded by the maximum value of the Zernike polynomials.
    + Evaluate how the FTmode is 
    + Use the genetic algorithm to make the FTmode to be the same as the beginning image (more symmetric and more centered).
- Main modified code: modified_file.mlx
